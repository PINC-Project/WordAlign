Thank you very much. 
The report we are discussing is related to very important objectives of the Europe twenty twenty strategy. 
By ten per cent we want to increase the number of higher institutions graduates and also there have to be more investments by~ at~ +ao+ up to three per cent into education research. 
Many universities are going to benefit from those measures. 
We should, in my view, I think, use that mechanisms that are most useful. 
For instance, the American partnerships between businesses and universities, I think, should be made use of. 
What can we do to use better the research results from universities that should be implemented in practice and businesses. 
What is also important is how to support, students' scholarships are very important.

I think this system should be launched as early as possible. 
We have to support also PhD students. 
I think the European Social Fund could be used on Marie Curie programme. 
What else can we do to create better examples of public- private partnerships?

We should perhaps, do more for incentives for entrepreneurs. 
How can we involve better small and medium- sized enterprises and encourage students to work in them?

I think there is much less that has to be done. 
It is also important not to invest only in different technologies, but also we have to invest in humanities and arts. 
And I think there's also a need for better cooperation in this regard. 
And the last point in my part today. 
China has the same number of students as the whole of European Union, so I'll~ I think w~ we, this is our common task to do more, 
and the involvement of business will be a very good solution to win this global competition. 
Thank you.
