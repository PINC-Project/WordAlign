Research and scientific development, training students, these are the main tasks of universities. 
As for the priorities of the Lisbon Strategy, to put it briefly, we speak about knowledge- based economy, research development. 
Even if we're not quite happy with the results of the strategy, but I think the objectives are still very much topical. 
Now, what are the measures that should be taken to achieve those objectives? 
I think better cooperation between universities and enterprises is very valuable. 
We need to finance research also by businesses. 
What can we do more? 
Better contacts between different universities in different countries is also desirable. 
We need to have, perhaps, more funds for different scholarships. 
We need to finance students contacts also with different enterprises. 
And what is also needed is mobility of s~ university staff.

We need to do more to finance research. 
To finish, let me state that the best investment is investment into education, young people's education.
