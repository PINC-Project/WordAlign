Thank you very much, President, thank you to the off~ President's office and the Comiss~ Comissioner as well. 
Many ideas form we speak about these summits, you can go back over ten years, and similar plans or proposals will come forward from Members within this House, from members of the Council and also from Commissioners. 
And, if anything, the last year has proven one thing to me, 
and that is, when the Union acts together in solidarity with big plans and big ambitions, it moves the world. 
And maybe now is the time for greater plans and bigger ambitions as regards how we move forward. 
Many have spoken with regard to the scourge of unemployment which has come upon so many people in the last number of months, and that now is the time to take serious action to get rid of the dead wood of regulation, get rid of the dead wood of blockages to businesses and entrepreneurs creating those businesses. 
And finally, could I say, that when we speak about solidarity, it's not about the big against the small, 
and one fear that I have is that the new G Twenty could impact negatively on small countries and medium- sized countries that are emerging in these new markets. 
And finally, to the President- in- Office, you might put the issue of term extension of copyright on the agenda for the Council as well +aa+ under the Swedish Presidency. 
Thank you.
