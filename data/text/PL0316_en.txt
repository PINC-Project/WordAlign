Mister president, ladies and gentlemen. 
The report by mister Janusz Wojciechowski on the council repo~ +eeh+ regulation on the protection of animals at the time of their killing refers to a very important issue of animal welfare. 
Indirectly, +eh+ it poses a question as to to which extent we are capable of +eh+ breaking with tradition and taking into account the feelings and anxieties not only those +ehm+ felt by humans, but also by animals. 
Unfortunately, in spite of the development of our culture and civilization, millions of animals and birds are being killed year in, year out. Some of them without stunning. 
+Eh+ hereby we have a question. Why do people who are educated and civilised treat animals as barbarians would? 
What can we do in order to change this situation? 
The report addresses some of these questions, but it fails to solve some basic issues related to the legislation concerning ritual slaughtering and the consciousness, the approach of the citizens. 
We need to solve these problems in the new term of office of the parliament and the +eh+ commission. 
I hope that further work will be underscored by the feeling that an animal his a feeling~ is a feeling being and we need to respect it and protect it. 
Thank you.
