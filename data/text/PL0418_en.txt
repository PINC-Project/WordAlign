Mister President, I come from Gdansk which is located at the Baltic Sea, so I naturally support this pilot project +eee+ of a macro-region. 
I wish it every success. 
However, two reservations on my part. 
I want to peet~ to put more flesh on the bones, and we need money for that. 
And so we need proper sources of financing. 
If we don't have them, this is just +eee+ debating. 
So we have to decide whether we have extra money for the strategy, another source of financing, or do we have to make cuts in some other programmes to make these funds unavailable. 
That would be a disaster. 
And the second reservation. 
Unfortunately, this is still one of the most +eee+ polluted sea in +yyy+ the European Union. 
And, unfortunately, the project of Nord Stream place a part here. 
+y+ We, of course, have to diminish our +mmmm+ dependence on gas supply from Russia. 
However, the +yy+ EU is not consistent, we have seen + yyyy+ first + yyy+ +kk+ +mmmmmm+ no, then yes for the Nord Stream.
