Thank you very much, +y+ Mister President.

Yes, this is very important because the problem of +yymmmm+ waste +yyy+ segregation has not been tackled properly so far, + mmmmmm+ not only in Poland, but in the European Union as such we are not doing a good job. 
And without the proper segregation we cannot use the bio-waste +yyy+ in a proper manner. 
But there are so many possibilities lying before us, 
the biogas installations for example. 
They should be supported all over the EU. 
They should +yyyyy+ get money from +yyy+ the funds, from regional funds, but +eee+ I think they should also be supported on a grass roots level, the local level, because they can generate electricity, for example. 
And +y+ both generation and distribution is much more economical from biogas installations.
