Mister President, I'd like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way that the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the European Union. 
The initial directive handed implementing measures to the European Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or my real parliament at Westminster. 
The ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink. 
But then again, you know, the people have been bypassed, but the European Union is very good at bypassing the people. 
Just take a look at what's happened with the Lisbon Treaty. 
It was allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative Party, who are the Jekyll and Hyde of British politics when it comes to the European issue. 
They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee. 
To conclude, on the eve of World War One, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out in Europe. 
We~ well done to the European Union, because your obsession with the unscientific cult of man- made climate change, what you're doing is you're proving Mister Gray's unfortunate prophecy to be correct.
