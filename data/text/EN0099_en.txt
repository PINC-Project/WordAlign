+Uh+ thank you very much, +uh+ I'm + uh+ very pleased with what I've heard here this evening and I would like to compliment the rapporteur and the Commissioner for the manner in which they've put their case clearly and succinctly. 
People have referred to the salient points, the rights of citizens, investment, controls, transparency, consolidation of the single market, a level playing field, accountability, proper competition and consumer protection. 
That's all very important. 
Mister van Nistelrooij said we're writing communications history here this evening. 
What happens~ needs to happen now is that this is transposed as soon as possible into national law and implemented, and the key points are three words, there will be free, fair and fast access to internet for people and businesses, whether they are at the centre of the Union or at its outermost regions. 
We've started to write history. 
We must now continue to do so and implement it for the good of all citizens. 
Well done! 
Thank you very much.
