It's on. Yeah. 
The policy towards the Tamil people +aaa+ by the Government of President Raza~ Rajapakse has resulted in a nightmare for both Sinhala and the Tamil people in Sri Lanka. 
+eee+ Massive repression by the Sri Lankan state against individuals and groups +eee+ who have stood against its chauvinist +ee+ policies. 
Now, after the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, the nightmare continues for the Tamil people, 
especially in the north of Sri Lanka, with three hundred thousand people forcefully detained in camps, including three one~ thirty- one thousand children, where +ee+ disease and malnutrition are rife. 
Now a new horror threatens, with reports the Rajapakse Government plans to settle Sinhala people in the east and north of Sri Lanka, in other words, to colonise the areas where the Tamil- speaking people are in the majority. 
That would be a recipe for cr~ +eee+ +eee+ for communal strife in the future. 
The Rajapakse Government is, in fact, a dictatorship with a very thin democratic +ee+ veneer. 
I welcome the opportunity to this resolution to condemn it. 
I do have a re~ reservation about paragraph four because the main terrorism, in fact, has come from the Rajapakse Government against the people. 
And wh~ but while, as a Socialist, I believe that guerrillaism in the conditions of Sri Lanka will not bring a solution, the Tamil people do have a right to defend themselves against military +eee+ re~ re~ repression. 
But the best way to defend the Tamil people is through a united struggle of Tamila~ Tamil and Sinhala workers and poor against the current government and its new liberal policies, and through the socialist transformation of Sri Lankan society, 
where the marvellous resources of that country could then be bet~ to~ used for the benefit of the entire population. 
I am proud to be associated with the United Socialist Party in Sri Lanka, a sister party of the Socialist Party in Ireland, which has heroically stood against the chauvinism of the government for the rights of the Tamil and Sinhala people and the rights of the Tamil people to self- determination.
