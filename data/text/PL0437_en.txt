This is also about security, security of gas supply. 
We have been campaining for years ab~ for the security of gas supply to be treated as a priority subject in the European Parliament. 
We cannot be dependent on only one supplier which is Russia. 
Russia uses th~ the gas supply as a means of exerting pressure on us. +eee+ 
And I think we have to be +eee+ especially careful about this. 
We as +eee+ Poles + eee+ we're talking about the Nord Stream project +ee+ which was a project +uyyee+ there was decided without proper consultation with the countries which were concerned. 
I think we have to be very careful about this.

We have to build a system of transmission or transport of gas which concerns and +eee+ + 
sss+ wh~ and which +eee+ will guarantee security of supply for every single member.
