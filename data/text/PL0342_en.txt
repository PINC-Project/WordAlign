Thank you, Chair. 
The US spend about fift~ +yy+ five hundred million +m+ + yyyy+ dollars for security and defence. 
The EU +yy+ spends a little bit over two hundred. 
But the question is +ńńńyy+ can we really +mmm+ use those two hundred +y+ billion +yyy+ to + mmm+ have similar capacity as the US. 
When I was +yy+ minister of defence, I met the +nnyy+ representatives of the + s+ +yyyy+ industry, 
and I told them, sorry, I'm the Minister of Defence, but not the Defence of Industry. 
The directive we are discussing today, and I would like to thank +yy+ mister Lambsdorff for his report. The directive will +mmmm+ help us to +yy+ spend the resources much more reliably, +y+ much better 
and +yyy+ the capacity of the EU will really be appropriate. 
Thank you.
