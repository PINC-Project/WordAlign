+ee+ Mr President, I warmly welcome the chance to place a question to President Barroso 
because the Conference of Committee Chairmen has, for the first time, been moved forward + um+ backward by an hour so us committee Chairmen are able to be here for the first time. 
+E+ I want to ask him about a policy to help framework conditions for research and innovation 
which I was rather disappointed to see did not make it into this first draft of twenty twenty, but I hope will be in future 
and that is to harness the huge potential of public procurement throughout the European Unio~ Union, to stimulate innovative product and services. 
And I want to ask him today if he would take up the recommendations endorsed almost unanimously by this Parliament in my report last November, which showed how this could be done. 
And just to give him an idea and to share it with colleagues, if one per cent of European public procurement was secured for innovative products and services, it would raise the investment in innovation across the European Union by no less than fifteen billion euros.
