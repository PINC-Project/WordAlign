Thank you very much, +aa+ Chair, Commissioner. 
I want to congratulate the reporter on +aa+ a great job of work that he has done on the future of our transport. 
I agree that the key for us in Europe would be to boost efficiency in +e+ the transport sector, but to achieve that we shouldn't need a +y+ degree of strategic integration of +a+ our instruments. 
The transport policy as a key element of the +y+ twenty twenty strategy should play an important, a key role for other sectoral policies. 
We need to include all member states in our systems, and we have to gradually +e+ support +eeeee+ +yyyy+ +yyy+ implementation and rollout of intelligent +ee+ technologies. 
We need to support trans- +yyy+ border, cross- border projects as well. +e+ 
For this, we might need a transport fund, but this transport fund should not cannibalise any money from +aaa+ the cohesion policy. 
We have to boost and support +ee+ the cohesion policy, not weaken existing instruments.
