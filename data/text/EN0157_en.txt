Yes, yes. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
+aaa+ There has been much talk in this Chamber this morning about developing countries playing their part in +aaa+ tackling climate change, 
and that is indeed true. 
And like many others, +aamm+ I would draw attention to the fact that, in order to do this in the regions of great poverty, this House, the Council and the Commission will have to take cognisance of the cost involved and there will have to be a strategy i~ in order to tackle this. 
However, I would not like to leave this House without +eee+ saying that, +aaamm+ in areas like my own in Northern Ireland, areas of high energy costs, there also needs to be some work done so that th~ those who are disadvantaged, where there are high levels of fuel poverty among disadvantaged people, + aaa+ where we have an economic base that relies on small business +aaaamm+ that these two +aaa+ need to be able +aaa+ to take a kind of +eeee+ +mm+ the costs +eeee+ of tackling climate change.
