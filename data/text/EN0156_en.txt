+eee+ Deforestation has been mentioned by many speakers and absolutely correctly so, industrialised deforestation, individual deforestation. 
I myself mentioned and noticed that, when I worked on a voluntary basis in Africa, day in, day out, I saw people climbing up the mountain, spending the whole day with their little axe, cutting down timber, coming down in the afternoon carrying their little bundle of timber on their head or on their bicycle. 
It's quite obvious that this cannot be tackled without dealing with the whole question of the global poverty because individuals are not going to stop chopping down wood for the greater good of society if it means they themselves are going to starve. 
So, climate change and the global poverty will have to be tackled hand in hand. 
Thank you very much.
