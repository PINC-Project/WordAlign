Thank you, Mister President. +eeemm+ The measures under discussion are part of the existing so- called area of justice, freedom and security, of which immigration is a part. +ee+ 
This is a~ about common, a common immigration and asylum policy 
and, however much the British Government may lie to the British people, we know that they intend that Britain should eventually be bound by it. 
But a one- size- fits- all immigration policy will won~ not work for Britain. 
Britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, more densely po~ populated, surprisingly, +aa+ than India, China and Japan. 
Net immigration to Britain is now running at about two hundred and thirty thousand people per annum, adding over a million new people to the population every five years. 
The population will rise from its current sixty- 
one point four million, an all- time high, to about seventy million plus in two thousand and thirty- one, and then spiral ever ep~ upwards. 
All this growth is due to immigration and births to immigrants. 
The UK Independence Party is not opposed to some immigration, but this should be strictly controlled and for the benefit of Britain and not the European Union or anybody else. 
Britain doesn't need a common European immigration policy. 
What we need to do is the end mass immigration now, 
introduce a strictly limited and controlled immigration policy. 
We should apply the terms of the nineteen fifty- one Convention on Refugees, 
which requires them to seek sanctuary in the first s~ designated safe country they come to, which is not a little island off the coast of Britain ca~ of the coast of Europe called Britain. 
We should end the promotion of multiculturalism, which is divisive and a recipe for conflict, and assimilate and integrate existing migrants into a common culture with respect for a common set of political and legal institutions. 
There should be no place in Britain, and, I suggest, anywhere in Europe, for Sharia law. 
Thank you.
