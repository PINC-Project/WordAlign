Thank you very much, President. 
During the previous term of the Parliament, I was on two occasions the reporter +yyy+ working on the starch quotas. 
+yyy+ I have a lot of contacts with the representatives of this sector, and I tried to take into account the wishes of those countries which were not happy with the quotas. 
And at that time I saw how delicate is th~ +yyy+ how delicate and balanced is +yyy+ prevailing within this +mmyyyyymm+ sector. 
Today we hear that the whole sector is threatened and it may disappear. 
And it grieves me to see sector after sector undergoing the same process. 
We had dairy products, sugar production, +y+ tobacco sector, 
and right now we're talking about potato starch which is facing the same kind of problems. 
And I believe that the time has come for us to think through +eeee+ and to see the entire issue. 
Perhaps we should look in a different direction. 
Perhaps the basic principles are not valid anymore. 
Thank you.
