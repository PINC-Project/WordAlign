Madam president, the Doha round was intended to assist the poorest countries in their development in order to get them out of their poverty. 
So we should + eh+ do whatever is possible in order to assist them, but we must not forget about our entrepreneurs or farmers. 
Hence my question, 
what are we going to do in order to protect small and medium-sized enterprises as well small farmers +eeh+ against bankruptcy when they face competition from +eeh+ China or Brazil. 
Let us put it very openly, +eh+ the import of any goods into the European Union requires certain standards to be met. 
This is when we can talk about a competition. 
+Eh+ it would be very difficult to complete negotiations in the near future, because this will require a lot of political good will. 
+Eh+ and there's a threat of growing protectionism +eh+ due to the financial crisis and economic crisis worldwide. 
Thank you.
