+ee+ Madam President, thanks to +aaa+ common +yyy+ agriculture policy, +ee+ we have +eee+ supply of high- quality products in Europe, and therefore +eee+ the right +eee+ quality and supply, + yyy+ determines +yyy+ our food security, 
and therefore +yyy+ information about the quality of products +yyy+ should reach the consumers. 
+eee+ All +eeemmm+ products +ee+ that +eee+ are allowed to be marketed +yyy+ in Europe +eenn+ should meet certain +eee+ criteria, and therefore all those +aaa+ +yyym+ features + eee+ should be specified on the package +eee+ because +eee+ +mmmemm+ those features determine the quality. 
Also, +eemm+ the +e+ place of origin of the raw materials and the place of processing should be indicated 
because the consumer should be aware of what he's buying and what he's + yy+ paying for. 
And this will strengthen the competitiveness of our products +eee+ vis-Ã -vis +eee+ imported products that do not meet the same requirements.
