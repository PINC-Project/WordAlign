Thank you. President. +yyyyy+ 
In my holding we've been producing potat~ +yy+ +yyyy+ starch potatoes for a number of years now. 
And similar to other growers throughout the European Union, I fear that the withdrawal of support to this production, targeting both production and +yyyy+ processing industry will cause very serious problems, and I +bb+ +mm+ expect that in two thousand +yy+ and thirteen they will see their economic situation deteriorate. 
So I would pronounce myself in favour of maintaining the existing instruments for the potato starch sector.

We need to have minimum prices, and we need to have at least a minimum support for a structurni~ restructuring purposes. 
+yyy+ When you talk about +y+ the sugar sector reform, I believe that this is not a very fortunate comparison because it was a great failure for the European farmers.

So this is not the right path, mister Commissioner.
