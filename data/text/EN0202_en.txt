Mister President, 
and like +rr+ my previous colleague who spoke earlier , I would like to say that I also have my reservations about Mister Barroso being + aaa+ re-elected as President of the Commission. 
After all, he, more than anyone,is committed to further European integration, often against the will of the peoples of Europe. 
But he did come to our group meeting, the ECR Group meeting, and explained that he was in favour of smart regulation. 
Now, of course, there's a much doubt about what smart regulation means. 
Many think, people believe that smart regulation is bad regulation, or any regulation is not very smart regulation. 
But I would ask him, if he really is in favour of smart regulation, to make sure that, on every directive, the Commission carries out a proper economic impact assessment. 
We have going through this House next year the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive. 
And the Commission has failed so far to conduct any proper economic impact assessment. 
In fact, they say it can't be done. 
How, under those circumstances, are we gonna get smart regulation? 
I ask Mister Barroso to reconsider.
