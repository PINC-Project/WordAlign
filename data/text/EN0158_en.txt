Thanks very much, President. 
President Barroso, unemployment could rise to twenty- seven million in the European Union +aaa+ next year, 
turning this financial and economic crisis into a social crisis. 
In the light of this, would you now agree that the economic recovery plan agreed last December was not enough in itself? 
In particular, would you agree that there's a need for a further stimulus? 
The ETUC has suggested one per cent of GDP, aimed at a positive entry strategy into the labour market 
that would be aimed at protecting viable employment and creating new jobs, +mkhkhmm+ in promoting intelligent work sharing? 
What will you do at EU level to promote jobs in the green and youth sectors? 
That's been suggested, for example, that a single strategic platform should be created at a EU level to bring together all key actors to work together on growth, innovation and jobs in each sector and to coordinate existing instruments, technology platforms, skills expert panels, joint technology initiatives, and so on. 
Would you agree that that would be a good idea to be implemented at European level?
