Thank you very much, +eh+ ladies and gentlemen. 
In this discussion, I want to ask you the following question. What has been the impact of the crisis on the implementation of the directive? 
In my country, in Poland, in spite of the crisis and many other transformation related difficulties, we managed to prepare an act on +eh+ services, which is based n~ on a fair degree of +eeh+ liberty 
in the hotel business, hospitality +eh+ business, +eh+ small arts and crafts business, +eh+ +eeh+ activity has been based on free competition. 
The compromise struck in two thousand and six assumed that certain areas would not be covered by the directive. 
So I want to ask you, what do you think about this now? 
Back in two thousand and six, it was assumed that further legislative work would be conducted on services of~ +uh+ of public +eh+ use. 
So, +eh+ using Commissioner's +eh+ words, glass is half empty, will there be another glass?
