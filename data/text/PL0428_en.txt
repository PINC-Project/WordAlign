Thank you very much, President. 
The discussion we're having tonight shows clearly that +y+ the debate on the legal regulation concerning cloning will be very difficult indeed. 
I believe that as we talk about novel technologies in food production, we are in a way jumping into a swimming pool without checking whether water is there.

+yyy+ +mm+ It is quite dangerous, we're not, 
we do not have scientific data which would be adequate. 
We have some ideas what, but we cannot really imagine the consequences, long- reaching consequences of the novel technologies in food production. 
We do not know how they will affect biodiversity. 
+yyy+ They balance amongst species and human health 
as well as the animal health because we hear that cloning does not favour good animal health. 
These animals are not very healthy and they suffer, 
so we need to tread carefully. 
W~ we do not know enough in order to take such risks. 
I believe that we should still have a ban on cloning of animals for food production.
