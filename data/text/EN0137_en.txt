Thank you, President. 
First time, pleased to see my former colleague Cecilia Malmstr√∂m here, 
particularly in light of the convincing yes to Lisbon in Ireland, followed by the signature of the democratically elected Polish President. 
And I think these two further endorsements will, I hope, facilitate the Swedish Presidency to preside over the full ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. 
However, most European citizens are far more concerned about what the EU is doing to deal with the current economic crisis rather than th~ the detail of Lisbon. 
So I say to my Eurosceptic friends, get over it. 
Before the Irish yes vote, twenty- seven million EU citizens voted yes, twenty- four million voted no. 
That's democratic legitimacy. 
So let's deal with the real world. 
And in this context, I want to speak about the Progress Microfinance Facility, 
which will give those who are unemployed the chance of the new start and open up the way to entrepreneurship. 
This facility will provide one hundred million euro and could leverage a further five hundred million of microcredit. 
But I'm saying to the Commission and to the Council, this is not nearly enough. 
This is a real opportunity for the EU to be responsive to the real needs of its citizens, but we need greater investment.
