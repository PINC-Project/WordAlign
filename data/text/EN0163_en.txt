Thank you very much, President. 
Democratisation assist the peaceful pursuit of politics, political change and the management of power in society, as well as respect for human rights. Supporting democracy underpins our foreign policy goals of preventing conflict and reducing poverty. 
That's why I was pleased to put the parliamentary amendment calling for European consensus on democratisation, and I'd like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for in, its initiative in this respect. 
President, I strongly believe that democratisation should inform all of the European Union's policies vis-à-vis third countries. 
And I have to say I condemn the European Conservative and Reform Group when they oppose paragraph ten in our text and seem to suggest that Europe can say one thing about democracy and do another about undemocratic countries when it suits us. 
No. 
Finally, as Missis Malmström has said, democracy building is much more than about elections. 
It's about building pluralist civil society. 
And that's why Europe should fund NGOs that increase citizen participation, support the inclusion of marginalised groups, provide training for legal professionals, promote freedom of expression and of association, stre~ strengthen political parties in parliament. 
It means supporting a civilian surge.
