Thank you, thank you, Mister President. 
I stand here as a proud Irish +eee+ +ee+ MEP today. 
It took the, the blood, sweat and tears of public representatives, athletes, business groups, +eee+ farmers and trade unionists to secure a historic +eeee+ yes vote. 
I'm also proud, I was in my home area of Tipperary last Friday, watching a landslide victory come true, 
which showed something that I've always believed in, that Ireland is a huge supporter of Europe, and we fully intend to play our role in the future. 
Now, colleagues, I know that the leprechauns in the UKIP, which attended the House last, last year following the previous referendum, have disappeared. 
Many of you will be glad to know that I believe, probably, that the Irish people have banished them forever from here. 
The Lisbon Treaty verdict was a victory for truth over the damned lies and myths perpetrated in some cases by extremists on the no side who tried to take advantage of people's genuine concerns. 
Those extremists met their match last Friday. 
However, it is a lesson we have to learn. 
All of us who support progressive politics and a progressive Europe need collectively to provide citizens with a greater incentive to engage with our European institutions. 
We can never ever take them for granted. 
Thank you.
