as a permanent representative for Armenia, as a permanent s~ spokesman for Armenia, I would like to underscore the need to adopt a coherent strategy of the EU for this region.

The +a+ reduction of red tape under Saakashvili, the corruption index went down by fifty per cent. 
The EU should appreciate the fact that president Saakashvili is very consistent in implementing a free- market reform and setting example for the others.
