Thank Thank you very much, Chai~ Chair, Commissioner. 
I said that this is the first document on energy after the Treaty of Lisbon, talking about solidarity in +ee+ energy matters. 
+e+ This was the +e+ a demand, also in part of Poland. +ee+ 
For many, many years, +ee+ we were painfully reminded +eeee+ of our dependence. +ee+ When we were in times of crisis in two thousand and nine without + yy+ interconnectors, without proper trans-European networ~ networks and without proper coordination, and most of all and most important of all, without a will, without political will, we cannot prevent future crises.

+ee+ Poland +eee+ is negotiating a contract for natural gas +eee+ and we fear +eemm+ a crisis. 
Of course, this +eeeee+ document could have been better, especially in the area of coordination +eeee+ played by the European Commission and also when we talk about the role of the High Commi~ of the High Representative. 
Mister Oettinger said that we will have to review this +eee+ regulation in two or three years +ee+ 
and I think this +yy+ show that we have not included everything in it.
