Thank you. 
Thank you very much, +eee+ Madam Chair. 
I'd like to thank the reporter who has led to compromise which is extremely difficult in energy matters. 
I'd like to thank +yy+ the Commissioner for getting involved i~ in the +yy+ gas contract between Poland and Russia. 
We +yy+ really appreciate the role of the European Commission. 
The issue of energy in contemporary Europe is the fact +e+ that determines +ee+ the independence of many states. 
That is why I'm amazed to hear some of the voices in this room who are stating that it is just an energy issue, +ee+ just an economic issue, that that is the only dimension of our discussion. 
No! 
Many countries in Europe treat energy as +e+ the w~ factor that determines their independence. 
If anybody read a~ any Russian document on that, 
you will see that Russians play two piano in terms of energy. 
The first one is the economic piano and the second one is political and security, related to security. 
So, if we miss anything today, we miss a greater involvement, also by the agendas of the European Commission that are responsible for the external matters so that we can play on two pianos as well.
