Mister Chairman, 
for many years now auth~ the authorities of Mexico have been waging a bloody war against +y+ drug cartels. 
They've involved +a+ over four thousand troops, and they've been quite successful on several occasions. 
Among them the arrests of +aa+ the heads of a Sinaloa and Juárez cartels, the destruction of twenty- three thousand of hectares of opium crops the closure of forty- +aaa+ five illegal laboratories, the arrest of thousands of people who are involved in drug trafficking. 
We must bear in mind, however, that Mexican cartels generate billions of dollars in income, incur~ incomparably more than the amounts that +t+ Mexico spends to combat the crime. 
Gangs spend massive amounts of money to corrupt politicians, judges and police officers, 
and that's why they, the authorities are losing the war. 
Fifteen thousand people lost their lives in two thousand and six. 
Especially endangered are journalists. Over sixty of them died recently, including Jorge Martínez. 
Without a +y+ commitment Mexico will never win that war.
