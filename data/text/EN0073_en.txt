+Uhm+ thank you, president, once again the House has been treated to two speeches by the +uhm+ BNP and UKIP, and once again the two parties are united in their~ in their belief in conspiracy theories, + uhm+ show there's very little difference between them. 
But, minister, I wanted to congratulate you first of all this morning for remaining ambitious about Copenhagen and sticking to the idea of a legally binding agreement. 
+Uhm+ this morning, the BBC is reporting that the White House is saying that it will come to Copenhagen with binding~ with~ with targets for cutting US emissions. 
And those of us who met US Members of Congress know that there is a very serious move and very serious prospect of legislation in the United States, so I think there is still real hope for +uhm+ an~ a deal in Copenhagen. 
But of~ Copenhagen will just be the beginning, because when we come back from Copenhagen, we in Europe will have to continue our work to cut our emissions. 
We've got to keep investing in energy efficiency, in renewables and in low-carbon technology. 
And I'm very pleased that last week we agreed as the European Union that +uhm+ there will be + uhm+ investment in technologies like carbon capture and storage, and one of those plants will come to my constituency in Yorkshire, at Hatfield. 
Commissioner Dimas, I want to thank you. 
I don't know whether this will be the last opportunity on the floor of the House to thank you for the work you have done as Commissioner over the last few years, but the Commission has really done a very good job in putting Europe in the lead, and +uhm+ your work ha~ has to be commended to this House. 
We'll see you in Copenhagen. 
We might see you here in January, but I just wanted to put that on the record. 
+Uhm+ finally, just to say, I hope that this House will vote for a good resolution on climate change, and I hope we will reject the amendments put down by Members of the House on the opposite side who seem to want to water down our commitments. 
They want to reduce our targets and they want to offset more of our emissions. 
If we are serious about climate change, if we want a good deal, we have to vote those amendments down.
