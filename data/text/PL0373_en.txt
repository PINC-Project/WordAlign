Thank you very much, Madam Preston. 
I'd like to +eeee+ draw your attention to a point nine of the report where it is emphasised that under the WTO negotiations the Commission should +eee+ +ee+ try to guarantee a deal on a non-trading +eeem+ +ee+ requirements, so that +ee+ all +ee+ products +ee+ meet the same criteria +aaa+ +mmaa+ +aa+ +mma+ animal welfare and otherwise. +ee+ 
The problem is that +eee+ +eee+ we are talking about it the + ee+ hundredth time and +eee+ we are talking about +yy+ applying the same standards to +eerm+ our +eee+ +e+ farmers and farmers from abroad. 
Unfortunately, our voice is not heard, and as a result our +eee+ farmers, our distribu~ our +eemm+ processors +ee+ have to +eee+ bear additional costs. 
And therefore this +ee+ competition is not fair and this has to be changed, and therefore I appreciate what is + y+ emphasized in the report.
