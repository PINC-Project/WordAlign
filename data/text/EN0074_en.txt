Mister President, I welcome the positive and determined stance being taken by the Swedish Presidency, and particularly the Minister's determination that the agreement in Copenhagen should be upgradable and include monitoring mechanisms so it can be adjusted in the light of new scientific research. 
The EU climate package passed last Dete~ last December was important in showing the seriousness of our commitment on climate change, and what has been agreed in recent months under the Swedish Presidency has also been important, particularly the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive recast, which will slash the carbon footprint of both new and renovated buildings. 
But there is one glaring gap in Europe's plans, and that is investment. 
It is a startling fact that the US, despite not having passed legislation, has nevertheless committed more than one hunded billion dollars to clean-energy spending and China has pledged two hundred billion dollars in its economic stimulus plan, whereas the EU commitment is little more than fifty billion dollars. 
We should bear this in mind and not be too self-congratulatory in the run-up to Copenhagen. 
Thank you.
