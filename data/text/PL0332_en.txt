Thank you very much. 
The EU attaches great importance to proper treatment of animals from the moment they are born until they are slaughtered. 
We know +mmm+ that you can +mmm+ a~ actually +mmmmmm+ assess whether the quality of meat is good by the way the animals have been, have been treated. 
There are proper scientific evidence for that. 
That is why we should +y+ enforce this regulation. 
I know that this is sometimes necessary to transport +mp+ animals over long distances. That requires much time. 
This is why we have to observe all the regulations. 
And it is important to +y+ think about the best way of enforcing these regulations. 
I think we should assess what the situation looks like in every member states and remember that this translates into cost and the final cost for consumers.
