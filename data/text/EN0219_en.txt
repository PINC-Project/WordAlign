All of us with car factories in our countries or, or region want to see their success, but that should not blind us to the problems and the reality of overcapacity that curbs profits and investment. 
I am hugely impressed by the engineering excellence I see at plants in my region, at Ellesmere Port and at Halewood, and on that basis alone they should prosper. 
But I'm deeply depressed by the attitude of the car industry as a whole of the ten years I've seen it work while I've been in this Parliament. 
Judged against the potential for environmental improvement, its record has been shameful. 
Of course, there's positive stories to be told. 
We see examples of innovation in our newspapers each day, but the industry as a whole fought against the introduction of catalytic converters, wildly exaggerating their cost. It made an agreement with us to reduce its CO two emissions and then reneged on it. 
Currently, it's trying to wriggle out of legal requirements that it uses air- conditioning coolants with a lower, much lower global warming potential than those used at present, and already it's lobbying to try and weaken the Commission's proposals on +aa+ on CO two emissions from vans and light commercial vehicles. 
Huge sums of money have been put into propping up this industry. 
And I think we c~ 
I think we, I think a public, should deserve a bit better. 
We hear from the component manufacturers that the car assemblers are too low in their ambitions. 
What we need is for the industry now to take a new attitude, and the industry's representatives, ACEA, in particular. 
We need the industry to recognise that it has obligations to +sss+ +sss+ +sss+ society as a whole and that its future is inextricably linked to environmental improvement.
