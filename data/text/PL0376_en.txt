Chairman, 
the crisis in the Eurozone shows what dangers may lie ahead of the e~ economic projects which are not underpinned by good cost and benefit analysis which are underpinned by bile~ ideological considerations, especially when integration can +yyy+ covers various economic conditions of various countries. 
So this begs the question whether some countries should have entered the Eurozone in a given time. 
The euro project at one point became not so much an economic as a political project, which was designed to speed up the European integration. 
And the acceleration is something that the European taxpayer may have to pay a lot for in the future. 
We should draw conclusions from this lesson in the future. 
The euro is not a response to the structural problems of many economies of too much debt and lack of +a+ +eeee+ public +ee+ +dd+ discipline. 
Member states are responsible for the financials and these problem should be resolved in, on a country- by- country basis in the first place.
