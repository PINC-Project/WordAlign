~k you very much, +eee+ Commissioner, Reporter. 
It is worth congratulating Alejo Vidal- Quadras because he's not only the main pillar of the compromise we have reached with the Council, but also a far- reaching compromise among the political forces in this Parliament. 
That's very important. 
The ECR group supports that compromise in spite of the fact that the Parliament at the very beginning proposed a much more ambitious solution, especially in terms of building infrastructure and the political involvement of the EU in resolving crises, also with the international dimension. 
The original version of the regulation did +eee+ include much more commitment.

Today, we've got much more potential in the regulation. 
I do hope this will not be a pretext to continue a policy of +aaamm+ indifference on the part of the member states and companies, indifference +eeemm+ versus the Russian abuse of the gas weapon in Europe. 
We do hope that the European Commission will definitely be fighting the abuse of the monopolistic +e+ position by Gazprom who, also for political reasons, would like to retain full control over gas pipelines in the EU, but also full control over the raw material after the gas has been sold in the community market. 
This happens at the expense of the common market, at the expense of the competition, consumer rights and at the cost of +eemm+ the development of modern technologies in the gas industry. 
This regulation could have been better, but it still remains +eee+ the most probable +eee+ chance to have a guarantee of the EU policy in terms of +aaaa+ ga~ gas crisis and it should be supported by our chamber.
