Thank you, Madam President. +eee+ 
The climate change conference in Copenhagen in December presents us with a un~ unique opportunity to address what is a very massive and huge problem. 
If we consider the consequences of global warming, it is obvious that the developing world is paying the price for environmental +eemmm+ + en+ da~ +e+ damage caused by the richer nations. 
Climate change is not the only environmental problem we face, 
but it is imperative that we attempt to address it in Copenhagen. It's the opportunity for the EU to speak with a one voice and find solutions to a problem which is affecting us all. 
All countries must play their part in terms of achieving targets, sustainable development. 
And developing world must be supported and encouraged, but targets set for these nations must be realistic. 
Can the Madam President say that, I know there are others who hold a different view from the view that I hold, but I do not believe that we can afford to wait fifty, sixty or seventy years to find out who was right or who was wrong. 
We have a responsibility today to act now, to do what we can while we are here, while we have that responsibility. 
Thank you, President.
