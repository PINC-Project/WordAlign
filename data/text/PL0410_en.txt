I would like to draw your attention to the fact of +eeee+ problems with medical care for MEPs in foreign countries. 
There were cases which mean that we have to create precise rules for MEPs who have to be provided with +fff+ constant medical care during repatriation procedures 
which not have a special unit responsible for that nowadays. 
I think we should remedy this situation. 
+mm+ Mister President, ladies and gentlemen, 
I would like to thank everyone for taking care of my health and me in this difficult +yyy+ times I had, 
and thank everyone +yymm+ from the hospital in Shanghai 
and +mm+ my thanks go also to my colleagues from the European Parliament, missis Claes, +yyyy+ among other people. 
Thank you very much indeed.
