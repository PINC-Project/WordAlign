President, as a representative of London, a city that has repeatedly been a target for terrorists in the past forty years, I have a great deal of sympathy with Sri Lankans of all ethnicities. 
The relentless terrorist campaign waged by the Tamil Tigers severely blighted the development of this beautiful country. 
President Rajapaksa came to power democratically, determined to defeat the LTTE, and his success should be congratulated by all of us who despise terrorism. 
The government now has the responsibility of building a post-conflict society with liberty, justice and equality for all Sri Lankans. 
Returning the IDPs home and trying the war criminals must now be the government's priority. 
While I concede that President Rajapaksa may have lost some international goodwill through some of his emergency actions in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, I am convinced to the best way forward is that we guarantee the development of a secure and prosperous Sri Lanka and support its democratically- elected leader and its government. 
The EU must maintain the GSP Plus trade agreements which, if removed, will directly destroy one million jobs and indirectly economically impact on two and a half million innocent Sri Lankan citizens. 
Thank you.
