Thank Thank you very much. 
Przepraszam. 
The regulation that we're going to vote today is a milestone in building common energy, energy community. 
There are +ee+ stipulations about solidarity in energy, which make it possible to use legal instruments +yy+ to provide us an response full of solidarity in crisis. 
The document that we're going to submit to vote is far from the ambitious version proposed by the go~ government, but it is a hope for an efficient functioning of the crisis mechanism in the future. 
The fact that we have reached a quick co~ + yy+ c~ quick compromise with the Council should be appreciated positively. 
I'd like to thank our reporter, mister Vidal- Quadras for being open from the very beginning to solutions proposed by our colleagues and +yyy+ inclined to reach a compromise that would be acceptable for all. 
The regulation is also an example that the European Parliament is a key player in interinstitutional battles and +yyy+ is courageous enough to fight for solutions that would have seemed irrealistic.
