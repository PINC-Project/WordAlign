+eee+ Thank you, Mister Pres~ President, +eeemm+ 
I support this resolution, e~ even though I think it is not critical enough of the Sri Lankan Government. 
Earlier this year, we witnessed the appalling military assault on the area held by the Tamil Tigers, without any regard for the lives or well- being of ceti~ citizens who were used as pawns indeed, +be+ in my view, by all sides, with the result of ninety thousand dead. 
The world stood horrified and helpless, yet still today, there are more than a quarter of a million Sri Lankan citizens, +aamm+ +a+ who are interned without adequate me~ me~ medical facilities, without clean water, sanitation or living space. 
Today's resolution is a relatively mild call on the Sri Lankan authorities to respect the rights of their citi~ citizens. 
It is my own view that it is, is, that it +ddy+ +ddy+ that if there is no the~ measurable progress soon on the demands in this resolution, then the European Union must bring economic and political pressure to bear on the regime in Sri~ Sri Lanka. 
Sri Lanka depends for its economic recovery on foreign direct investment and on EU economic support. 
We must use that leverage +yy+ in the interests of the Sri Lankan peoples, including the Tamil people. 
Thank you.
