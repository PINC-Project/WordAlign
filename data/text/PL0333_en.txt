President, Commissioner. 
First of all, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that we have no representative of the presidency, of the Czech presidency. 
So I think it's +yyy+ great shame that we do not have anyone representing the Czech Republic which is a country +eeeeee+ which +eee+ in a way inherits + ee+ a great tradition of fight for freedom and democracy in Europe. 
So I would like to repeat , I'm really sorry that we do not have, that we do not see, +eep+ representatives of this presidency. +eee+ I remember that +e+ during, for instance, German presidency we do not have such problems. 
We debate human rights today in Iran. 
Iran is a very important Middle East country, one of the countries which +yyy+ most likely will have a great say as regards the future of this region. 
This is especially important for the Iranian authorities to +eee+ keep to the standards as far as human rights are concerned, as far as the humanitarian law is concerned. 
We know that we are here today to fight for the rights of Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel Prize +eeeee+ Laureate. 
We know and +ee+ the public opinion knows as well that her persecution is not justified. 
I would like to also draw your affen~ attention to the fact that +eee+ the Shiraz University students were arrested in great numbers recently. 
Even now as we sit here, another six students were arrested on the twelfth of January, 
so we really have to fight also for the rights of the stu~ of students in Iran. 
Also, +aaa+ the persecution, for instance, +eee+ + eemme+ +e+ related to doctors who engage in HIV +ee+ testing and +ee+ analyses. 
I believe that +eee+ it's time we closely monitored the situation of human rights in this region. 
Thank you.
