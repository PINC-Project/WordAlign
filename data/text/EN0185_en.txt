Thank you very much, President. 
The decision is made. 
+aaaamm+ Much as I regret the first decision was not respected, +aaa+ we will have to await and see what +yyy+ ongoings, o~ o~ what outgoings there will be from this decision +aaaa+ will be. 
And if it is now up to others to decide, and I hope they're given the space to, to make that decision. 
I just hope that the high percentage that voted yes in the Republic of Ireland do not live to regret in the longer term. 
I wish to say no more about it. 
There is now a very heavy burden and responsibility on the shoulders of those who wish and desire an even deeper centralisation +eeeee+ of the decision- making process here in Brussels. 
I urge them not to get that far in front of the people that the people have no idea where they're heading or what their destiny may ultimately be. 
I am not anti-European, but what I do want is a Europe content within itself and able to allow those who disagree the right to put forward an alternative view, and we don't always get that anymore in this House.
