+eee+ It is interesting, if somewhat +eeee+ depressing to listen to the discussion and debate here this evening, particularly when the European Union is acting in good faith in trying to help countries in difficulties. 
Our own country, Ireland, has benefited to a certain extent, particularly the globalisation funds, which be upcoming, is an example of that. 
The same time, one wonders how, when the money is made available to these countries under what are described as harsh conditions, that there is maladministration taking place. 
One would imagine that part of those harsh conditions would be to ensure that there wouldn't be maladministration and, if there was, there will be a correction put in place. 
And, has the Commission or can the Commission ensure that these funds can either be cut off, withdrawn or some fines or other put in place? 
Because it's not acceptable that, if something is given, as my colleague, +ee+ Madam Harkin said, on trust, that is that trust isn't returned. 
And, secondly and finally, we will never get to the situation that Proinsias De Rossa spoke about of having a better society post-depression than we have now.
