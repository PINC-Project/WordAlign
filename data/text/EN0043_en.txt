Thank you, mister president, and I thank the Court of Auditors +eh+ in particular for putting forward this morning, in a very clear way, the contents of a massive report giving us the good and the bad, 
+ah+ and thankfully not the ugly  because, to some extent, we have cleared up the worst aspects of our accounting +ehm+ practices of the past. 
I want to +eh+ concentrate in particular on agriculture which, because it's been given a relatively clean bill of health, has virtually been dismissed in this debate. 
And I do so because I want to caution that we may be going back to the future. 
It is worth remembering this morning that agriculture has improved because we have decoupled, to a large extent, payments from production. 
We are giving the payments directly to the active farmers, the active producers, and therefore the possibility for errors has much been reduced. 
However, we are on the rural development now with the vehicle of modulation taking that money and using it in the area of rural development, 
where you have expressed serious concerns about, hence my comments about us possibly going back to the future. 
I also worry about how do we account for issues like water management, climate change and biodiversity. 
Think of the complex~ complexity of the rules that will surround all of these things, and rightly so, if public money is being spent in that direction, and the difficulties and the cost of complying with those particular rules. 
We're looking at a review of the European Union's budget thanks to the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who~ whose government +eh+ doesn't have a particularly clean record when it comes to their own sets of accounts. 
And again, under that review we will be looking at spending money in areas which the Court of Auditors clearly have concerns, particularly in research and innovation. 
So let's be very careful that the good work we have done will not be unpicked in what we are about to do. 
Thank you.
