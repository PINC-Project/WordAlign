Ladies and gentlemen, 
in acceding to the European convention for the protection of human rights, we must +eee+ at all cost +ee+ avoid important dangers. 
We have a +mm+ major problem +ee+ to do with the competition of the two +ee+ courts, one in Strasbourg and the European Court of Justice. 
We will also have difficulties as a result of the existence of the two documents. +eee+ The European Convention and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. 
It'll be difficult to unders~ to +yyy+ explain to the citizens which +eee+ court will be competent, 
so there may be conflicts on court jurisdiction and the legal bases. 
And there is also a danger that +eeee+ U~ Union +skkyyy+ accession to the European Convention will also limit +eee+ respect for the constitutional traditions of the member states, which lay down the general +yyy+ rules of law. 
And +yyy+ our accession to the convention should not serve the +eee+ purpose of circumventing the binding protocol to the Lisbon Treaty, which incidentally disables the application of the Chart of Fundamental Rights in the case of the United Kingdom and Poland.
