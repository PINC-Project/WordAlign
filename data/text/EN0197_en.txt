Thank you very much, President. 
President, I have to agree with Misses Jeggle. 
I am utterly astonished that we have, in front of the whole Parliament here in Strasbourg, we have an urgency debate on a traffic accident in Kazakhstan, 
an accident albeit where somebody was tragically killed 
and where the driver of the car happens to be a human rights activist and has been duly sentenced in a court of law to four years in prison, 
but even in a low- security prison, which has suddenly become, in the terms of the +aa+ resolution, a labour camp. 
I am afraid, Chairman, that bringing this kind of matter before this House really brings the reputation of this House into disrepute, 
and it means that the good work that we try to do in human rights is devalued, when we start talking about traffic accidents. 
Are we seriously suggesting the Kazakh Government threw a human rights activist, +aaa+ shou~ +aa+ +aa+ a civilian under the car wheels of a human rights activist? 
Are we seriously suggesting that the sentence is too harsh for somebody who was convicted of manslaughter? 
We cannot go on traducing a +aa+ country like Kazakhstan, simply because of political motivation, to try and bring down their reputation before they chair the OSCE next year. 
This is politically motivated, and it's a disgrace that it's on the agenda. 
I hope the House will throw out these resolutions and support the amendments.
