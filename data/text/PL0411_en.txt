Ladies and gentlemen, the crisis +eee+ hit +ee+ many people very, very hard, 
but I would like to talk today +eee+ about + ee+ young people in particular and people who live in +y+ poverty, who are excluded, people who have been + ee+ unemployed for a long time. 
The young people are +ee+ account for the largest part of the unemployed. 
+e+ They passed a threshold of adult life without any perspective for a good life. 
+ee+ We know that +e+ good education is the key here. 
We have to invest in development of young people. 
We know that factories have been closed, many jobs have been lost. 
Fortunately, we still have schools and universities +ee+ running 
and +ee+ are possibilities to offer vocational training as well. 
We have to support the education for young people, especially in the times of crises. 
And I'm happy to see the report of madam Sidonia JÄ™drzejewska who prepared a document about budget and with special attention to the young people issue.
