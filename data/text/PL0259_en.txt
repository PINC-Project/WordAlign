Thank you very much. 
Debates, negotiations, talks about the upcoming Copenhagen summit have been going on uninterrupted for months 
and we see various countries trying to raise the stakes +eh+ and propose more and more ambitious + eh+ targets, other countries are totally passive. And in this whole mess, it's easy to lose sight of the +eh+ essence of this agreement. 
We want to fight climate change that could potentially translate into a disaster for all of us. 
Therefore, it's extremely important that we engage in some sort of +eh+ education or work, 
because my impression is + eh+ that our citizens and our elites have gone their separate ways. 
It's important that whatever proposals are presented in Copenhagen, Copenhagen should not be treated as another folly of our politicians.

Fight against climate change should not be treated as a capricious exercise on the part of rich countries that want to impose their points of view on others. 
Therefore, we need to +eh+ step up and continue our information + eh+ campaigns, 
we also need + eh+ effective and efficient technology for +eh+ carbon capture and storage. 
This technology should be given the same political status as other sources of renewable energies. 
This should be our priority. This should be the priority for the European Institute of Technology that we created some time ago. 
And last but not least, the costs of the creation of a~ of the special fund to fight climate change, the cost should be borne equally by all member states.
