Thank you very much, President. 
+y+ Thank you very much. 
I +ksz+ would like to congratulate mister Bov√©. 
It is an, +dd+ good job, well done indeed. 
+yy+ You're developing the ideas which the European Parliament has already expressed in its written statement +yyyyy+ in two thousand and eight. 
I was one of the authors of this statement 
and +u+ this was the first time that we spoke against an abuse of market power, of +yy+ reselling retail chains with respect to farmers.

Today in Poland, we are closing the harvest time. 
We break bread made of the new, from the new harvest. 
And the share of farmers is decreasing in this new~ newly baked bread. 
It's only ten per cent today. 
It used to be twenty- five per cent not long ago.

Farmers are the weakest chi~ +yyy+ weakest link in the chain of farming supply. 
Politicians talk about the need to improve the functioning of the market, but they seem to forget that the market will not deal with every problem wherever safety and security is +yy+ involved. 
In this particular case, food safety. 
It is good if we have a free market. 
It is not a good thing, however, to have a wild market. 
And here we can talk about the wild market with respect to farming produce. 
Large retail networks can dictate their terms to the farmers who are always the weaker partner, even though they are organised right now. 
This needs to change, 
and I deeply believe that this report will not remain just words on paper. 
I believe that we will have action that will follow, especially at the ma~ +yyj+ European Union level because since we talk about the E~ +iinn+ +yyyy+ single market, we need to have single set of regulations.
