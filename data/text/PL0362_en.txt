Ladies and gentlemen, President. 
I think the EU does need a new strategy which +y+ would allow us to react to the financial crisis. 
And important element of the strategy should be to enhance the freedom of movement of all kinds of people, students, scientists, pensioners, workers. 
And this is clearly mentioned in the resolution. 
It is also good that we emphasise the support for small and medium enterprises because without them know we cannot get out of this crisis. 
Some people think that this strategy doesn't emphasise enough the notion of the cohesion policy. 
I would beg to differ because this emphasis is there. We say that it is important for the future of the Union. 
However, if this is not implemented, no strategy is going to help us get on our feet.
