President, 
I would like to congratulate our reporter, Alejo Vidal- Quadras, who one year ago faced a very difficult challenge to +y+ prepare a report on security of energy supply in the European Union. 
Both the Parliament and the Council +mmmm+ have worked towards compromise. 
The regulation on security of gas supply should +yy+ facilitate the actions taken py~ by gas undertakings a~ +bb+ by the member states. 
And it obliges them all to act +yy+ +mmmmm+ on a precautionary principle. 
As we have heard, +mmmm+ the reporter said that this document answers or tries to answer the real problems of the European Union. 
I would like to comment on the general situation and say that of course, a new crisis can come up in a time. 
We can see how the situation develops, especially between Poland and Russia. I'm talking about the gas contract. 
And this is also a new challenge for the European Commission. 
Poland has become a battlefield between the Commission and the Russian Federation as far as the +yy+ gas l~ market liberalisation is concerned. 
If the commission wants to +mmmmmm+ do well here, it should focus on diversification. 
Please remember that Poland is very limited as far as diversification is concerned. 
Unfortunately, we +aaa+ faced with a possibility of huge crisis in terms of gas supply.

And Polish economy may suffer seriously. 
We st~ expect the support of the European Commission, we expected to stand by our side. 
We are a transit country. 
We are not a dead end in terms of +yy+ supply rude, 
and I do hope the member states, would, all the member states would appreciate + yy+ the action on +yy+ security of gas supply.
