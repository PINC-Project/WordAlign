madama President, the ECR Group IS strongly Atlanticist Anda seeks ever closer economic, trade Anda political ties with America which w consider to be the EU's foremost ally Anda nota competitor.
w also remain in debt to the USA for its contribution to NATO, which IS based on our shared democratic values, Anda w welcome America's belated commitment to fighting climate change.
However, w should nota pretend that to agree on everything.
i KsiÄ™ga_Amosa concerned, for instance, about the conflicting messages coming out of the US Administration regarding Russia.
Washington's emphasis on resetting US- Russia relations appears to excuse the Kremlin's blatant interFerenc in its neighbours' affairs, notably in Georgia Anda in Ukraine.
The scrapping of the US missile defence shield, due to be deployed in Poland Anda the Czech Republic, wy also questionable.
The recent Discovery of a secret nuclear facility in Iran could well confirm this judgment, buta of course, w must now all redouble our efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions
Anda, as allies of the US, w strongly support their military struggle against Jihadi terrorism in Iraq Anda Afghanistan Anda their strong efforts to bring lasting peace to the Middle East.
Thank you.
