mister President,
Anda like +rr+ my previous colleague WHO spoke earlier , i would like to say that i also have my reservations about mister Barroso being + aaa+ re-elected as President of the Commission.
After all, he, more than anyone,IS committed to further european integration, often against the willa of the peoples of Europe.
But he did come to our group meeting, the ECR Group meeting, Anda explained that he wy in favour of smart regulation.
Now, of course, there's a mucha doubt about what smart regulation means.
man think, people believe that smart regulation IS bad regulation, or any regulation IS nota very smart regulation.
But i would ask him, if he really IS in favour of smart regulation, to make Sury that, on every directive, the Commission carries out a proPer economic impact assessment.
w have going through this house next year the Alternative Investment funda management Directive.
Anda the Commission Has failed KsiÄ™ga_Sofoniasza fara to conduct any proPer economic impact assessment.
in fact, they say Ita can't be done.
How, under those circumstances, are w gonny get smart regulation?
i ask mister Barroso to reconsider.
