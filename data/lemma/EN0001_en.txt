+eh+ thank you, mister president, firstly, my thanks to mister Samecki for his good work.
i think w all agree with the theme we're discussing here this morning, nota only should Ita apply across the european Union buta Ita sh~ should apply worldwide as well.
Anda this IS something w discussed recently at the Canadian delegation, which IS a step in the right direction.
But if w wanta that +eh+ utopian situation, w must ensure that the professional qualifications are of an equal standard across the european Union Anda worldwide, ideally.
Anda there IS anecdotal evidence to suggest that, in some countries at least, when students haven't reached the educational standard to qualify for a course, they can go to another country Anda pay to do Ita there.
KsiÄ™ga_Sofoniasza there IS need for independent verifiable evidence that the standards are equal Anda, if they are equal, Then there IS no excuse for nota transposing this theme across the european Union Anda, hopefully, in due course, worldwide,
to attain what w desire, free movement of professional~ in labour.
Thank you very mucha.
