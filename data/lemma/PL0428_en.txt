+yyy+ +milimetr+ Ita IS quite dangerous, we're nota,
w do nota have scientific data which would be adequate.
w have some ideas what, buta w cannot really imagine the consequences, Longa- reaching consequences of the novel technologies in food production.
w do nota know how they willa affect biodiversity.
+yyy+ They balance amongst species Anda human health
as well as the animal health because w hear that cloning does nota favour good animal health.
