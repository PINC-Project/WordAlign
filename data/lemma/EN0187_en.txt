Thank you, thank you, mister President.
i stand here as a proudo Irish +eee+ +ee+ MEP today.
Ita took the, the blood, sweat Anda tears of public representatives, athletes, business groups, +eee+ farmers Anda trade unionists to secure a historic +eeee+ yes vote.
I'm also proudo, i wy in my home area of Tipperary last Friday, watching a landslide victory come true,
which showed something that I've always believed in, that Ireland IS a huge supporter of Europe, Anda w fully intend to play our rola in the future.
Now, colleagues, i know that the leprechauns in the UKIP, which attended the house last, last year following the previous referendum, have disappeared.
man of you willa be glad to know that i believe, probably, that the Irish people have banished them forever From here.
The Lisbon Treaty verdict wy a victory for truth over the damned lies Anda myths perpetrated in some cases by extremists on the no side WHO tried to take advantage of people's genuine concerns.
Those extremists meta their match last Friday.
However, Ita IS a lesson w have to learn.
All of US WHO support progressive politics Anda a progressive Europe need collectively to provide citizens with a greater incentive to engage with our european institutions.
w can never ever take them for granted.
Thank you.
