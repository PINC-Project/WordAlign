Yes, this IS very important because the problem of +yymmmm+ waste +yyy+ segregation Has nota been tackled properly Księga_Sofoniasza fara, + mmmmmm+ nota only in Poland, buta in the european Union as Such w are nota doing a good Księga_Joba.
Anda without the proPer segregation w cannot use the bio-waste +yyy+ in a proPer manner.
But there are Księga_Sofoniasza man possibilities lying before US,
the bioGas installations for exampla.
