President,
i would like to congratulate our reporter, aleja Vidal- Quadras, WHO on year aga faced a very difficult challenge to +y+ prepare a reporta on security of energy supply in the european Union.
Both the Parliament Anda the Council +mmmm+ have worked towards compromise.
The regulation on security of Gas supply should +yy+ facilitate the actions taken py~ by Gas undertakings a~ +bb+ by the member states.
Anda Ita obliges them all to act +yy+ +mmmmm+ on a precautionary principle.
as w have heard, +mmmm+ the reporter said that this document answers or tries to answer the real problems of the european Union.
i would like to comment on the general situation Anda say that of course, a New crisis can come up in a time.
w can see how the situation develops, especially between Poland Anda Russia. I'm talking about the Gas contract.
Anda this IS also a New challenge for the european Commission.
Poland Has become a battlefield between the Commission Anda the Russian Federation as fara as the +yy+ Gas l~ market liberalisation IS concerned.
If the commission wants to +mmmmmm+ do well here, Ita should focus on diversification.
Please remember that Poland IS very limited as fara as diversification IS concerned.
Unfortunately, w +aaa+ faced with a possibility of huge crisis in terms of Gas supply.
***blank***
Anda Polish economy May suffer seriously.
w st~ expect the support of the european Commission, w expected to stand by our side.
w are a transit country.
w are nota a dead end in terms of +yy+ supply rudy,
Anda i do Hope the member states, would, all the member states would appreciate + yy+ the action on +yy+ security of Gas supply.
