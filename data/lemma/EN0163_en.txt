Thank you very mucha, President.
Democratisation assist the peaceful pursuit of politics, political change Anda the management of power in society, as well as respect for human rights. Supporting democracy underpins our foreign polica goals of preventing conflict Anda reducing poverty.
That's why i wy pleased to Put the parliamentary amendment calling for european consensus on democratisation, Anda I'd like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for in, its initiative in this respect.
President, i strongly believe that democratisation should inform all of the european Union's policies vis-à-vis third countries.
Anda i have to say i condemn the european Conservative Anda reforma Group when they oppose paragraph ten in our text Anda seem to suggest that Europe can say on thing about democracy Anda do another about undemocratic countries when Ita suits US.
no.
Finally, as Missis Malmström Has said, democracy building IS mucha more than about elections.
It's about building pluralist civil society.
Anda that's why Europe should funda NGOs that increase citizen participation, support the inclusion of marginalised groups, provide training for legal professionals, promote freedom of expression Anda of association, stre~ strengthen political parties in parliament.
Ita means supporting a civilian surge.
