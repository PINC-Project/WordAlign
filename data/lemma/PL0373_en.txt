I'd like to +eeee+ Drawa your attention to a pointa nine of the reporta where Ita IS emphasised that under the WTO negotiations the Commission should +eee+ +ee+ try to guarantee a deal on a nona-trading +eeem+ +ee+ requirements, KsiÄ™ga_Sofoniasza that +ee+ all +ee+ products +ee+ meet the sam criteria +aaa+ +mmaa+ +aa+ +mma+ animal welfare Anda otherwise. +ee+
The problem IS that +eee+ +eee+ w are talking about Ita the + ee+ hundredth time Anda +eee+ w are talking about +yy+ applying the sam standards to +eerm+ our +eee+ +e+ farmers Anda farmers From abroad.
Unfortunately, our voice IS nota heard, Anda as a result our +eee+ farmers, our distribu~ our +eemm+ processors +ee+ have to +eee+ bear additional costs.
Anda therefore this +ee+ competition IS nota fair Anda this Has to be changed, Anda therefore i appreciate what IS + y+ emphasized in the reporta.
