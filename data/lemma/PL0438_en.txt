~k you very mucha, +eee+ Commissioner, reporter.
Ita IS worth congratulating aleja Vidal- Quadras because he's nota only the maina pillar of the compromise w have reached with the Council, buta also a fara- reaching compromise among the political forces in this Parliament.
That's very important.
The ECR group supports that compromise in spity of the fact that the Parliament at the very beginning proposed a mucha more ambitious solution, especially in terms of building infrastructure Anda the political involvement of the EU in resolving crises, also with the international dimension.
The original version of the regulation did +eee+ include mucha more commitment.

Today, we've got mucha more potential in the regulation.
i do Hope this willa nota be a pretext to continue a polica of +aaamm+ indifference on the parta of the member states Anda companies, indifference +eeemm+ versus the Russian abuse of the Gas weapon in Europe.
w do Hope that the european Commission willa definitely be fighting the abuse of the monopolistic +e+ position by Gazprom WHO, also for political reasons, would like to retain full control over Gas pipelines in the EU, buta also full control over the Rawa material after the Gas Has been sold in the community market.
This happens at the expense of the common market, at the expense of the competition, consumer rights Anda at the cost of +eemm+ the development of moderna technologies in the Gas industry.
This regulation could have been better, buta Ita still remains +eee+ the most proBabiel +eee+ chance to have a guarantee of the EU polica in terms of +aaaa+ ga~ Gas crisis Anda Ita should be supported by our chamber.
