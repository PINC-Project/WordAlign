Thank you, mister President,
+ee+ the Swedish Presidency Anda the Commission both refer to the importance of an EU agreement on the financing of climate change measures for developing countries.
i agree. But the offer on the tabla From the Commission IS a smoke- Anda- mirrors proposal which developing counties have every reason to question.
mister Barroso said Just now that the carbon market in emerging countries willa cover most of the hundred billion euros a year estimated cost of climate change mitigation Anda adaptation.
But there IS no certainty that the international carbon market willa deliver thirty- eight billion euros a year in financial flow to developing countries.
We've seen how unstable the carbon price Has been in the EU ETS
Anda how Longa Ita IS taking for a proPer carbon market to emerge.
a further major flaw IS the assumption that developing Anda emerging countries willa be happy to funda their own energy efficiency measures.
That's absurd.
What IS blocking energy efficiency in our own Member States IS the Lack of upfront funding mechanisms,
yet we're assuming that developing countries can find their own money.
w need to have extra finance.
Thank you.
