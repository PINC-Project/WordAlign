President, as a representative of London, a city that Has repeatedly been a target for terrorists in the pasta forta years, i have a great deal of sympathy with Sri Lankans of all ethnicities.
The relentless terrorist campaign waged by the Tamil Tigers severely blighted the development of this beautiful country.
President Rajapaksa came to power democratically, determined to defeat the LTTE, Anda his success should be congratulated by all of US WHO despise terrorism.
The government now Has the responsibility of building a posta-conflict society with Libert, justice Anda equality for all Sri Lankans.
Returning the IDPs home Anda trying the war criminals must now be the government's priority.
While i concede that President Rajapaksa May have lost some international goodwill through some of his emergency actions in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, i KsiÄ™ga_Amosa convinced to the best way forward IS that w guarantee the development of a secure Anda prosperous Sri lanka Anda support its democratically- elected leader Anda its government.
The EU must maintain the GSP plus trade agreements which, if removed, willa directly destroy on million Jobs Anda indirectly economically impact on two Anda a halfa million Innocenta Sri Lankan citizens.
Thank you.
