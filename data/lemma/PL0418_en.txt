mister President, i come From Gdansk which IS located at the Baltic Sea, Księga_Sofoniasza i naturally support this pilot project +eee+ of a macro-region.
i wish Ita every success.
However, two reservations on my part.
i wanta to peet~ to Put more flesh on the bones, Anda w need money for that.
Anda Księga_Sofoniasza w need proPer sources of financing.
If w don't have them, this IS Just +eee+ debating.
Księga_Sofoniasza w have to decide whether w have extra money for the strategy, another source of financing, or do w have to make cuts in some other programmes to make these funds unavailable.
That would be a disaster.
Anda the second reservation.
Unfortunately, this IS still on of the most +eee+ polluted sea in +yyy+ the european Union.
Anda, unfortunately, the project of Nord Stream plac a parta here.
+y+ w, of course, have to diminish our +mmmm+ dependence on Gas supply From Russia.
However, the +yy+ EU IS nota consistent, w have seen + yyyy+ First + yyy+ +kk+ +mmmmmm+ no, Then yes for the Nord Stream.
