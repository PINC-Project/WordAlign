Thank you very mucha.
The EU attaches great importance to proPer treatment of animals From the moment they are Born until they are slaughtered.
w know +MMM+ that you can +MMM+ a~ actually +mmmmmm+ assess whether the quality of meat IS good by the way the animals have been, have been treated.
There are proPer scientific evidence for that.
That IS why w should +y+ enforce this regulation.
i know that this IS sometimes necessary to transport +MP+ animals over Longa distances. That requires mucha time.
This IS why w have to observe all the regulations.
Anda Ita IS important to +y+ think about the best way of enforcing these regulations.
i think w should assess what the situation looks like in every member states Anda remember that this translates into cost Anda the final cost for consumers.
