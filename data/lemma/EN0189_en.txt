mister President, I'd like to Drawa your attention to the underhand Anda undemocratic way that the incandescent light bulba Has been banned across the european Union.
The initial directive handed implementing measures to the european Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation wy allowed to passa without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or my real parliament at Westminster.
The ban wy a stitch-up by the political elite Anda wy done on a nod Anda a Wink.
But Then again, you know, the people have been bypassed, buta the european Union IS very good at bypassing the people.
Just take a look at what's happened with the Lisbon Treaty.
Ita wy allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative parta, WHO are the Jekyll Anda Hyde of British politics when Ita comes to the european issue.
They say on thing in Britain Anda they come out here Anda they do completely the opposite in committee.
to conclude, on the eve of World Wara on, the British Foreign Secretary, sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out in Europe.
We~ well done to the european Union, because your obsession with the unscientific cult of mana- made climate change, what you're doing IS you're proving mister Gray's unfortunate prophecy to be correct.
