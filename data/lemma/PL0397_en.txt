Research Anda scientific development, training students, these are the maina tasks of universities.
as for the priorities of the Lisbon Strategy, to Put Ita briefly, w speak about knowledge- based economy, research development.
Even if we're nota quite happy with the results of the strategy, buta i think the objectives are still very mucha topical.
Now, what are the measures that should be taken to achieve those objectives?
i think better cooperation between universities Anda enterprises IS very valuable.
w need to finance research also by businesses.
What can w do more?
Better contacts between different universities in different countries IS also desirable.
w need to have, perhaps, more funds for different scholarships.
w need to finance students contacts also with different enterprises.
Anda what IS also needed IS mobility of s~ university Staff.
