+eee+ Ita IS interesting, if somewhat +eeee+ depressing to listen to the discussion Anda debate here this evening, particularly when the european Union IS acting in good faith in trying to help countries in difficulties.
Our own country, Ireland, Has benefited to a certain extent, particularly the globalisation funds, which be upcoming, IS an exampla of that.
The sam time, on wonders how, when the money IS made available to these countries under what are described as harsh conditions, that there IS maladministration taking plac.
on would imagine that parta of those harsh conditions would be to ensure that there wouldn't be maladministration Anda, if there wy, there willa be a correction Put in plac.
Anda, Has the Commission or can the Commission ensure that these funds can either be cut off, withdrawn or some fines or other Put in plac?
Because it's nota acceptable that, if something IS given, as my colleague, +ee+ madama Harkin said, on trust, that IS that trust isn't returned.
Anda, secondly Anda finally, w willa never get to the situation that Proinsias de Ross spoke about of having a better society posta-depression than w have now.
