Thank you, President.
First time, pleased to see my former colleague Cecilia Malmström here,
particularly in light of the convincing yes to Lisbon in Ireland, followed by the signature of the democratically elected Polish President.
Anda i think these two further endorsements willa, i Hope, facilitate the Swedish Presidency to preside over the full ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
However, most european citizens are fara more concerned about what the EU IS doing to deal with the current economic crisis rather than th~ the detail of Lisbon.
Księga_Sofoniasza i say to my Eurosceptic friends, get over Ita.
Before the Irish yes vote, twenty- seven million EU citizens voted yes, twenty- four million voted no.
That's democratic legitimacy.
Księga_Sofoniasza let's deal with the real world.
Anda in this context, i wanta to speak about the Progress Microfinance Facility,
which willa give those WHO are unemployed the chance of the New start Anda open up the way to entrepreneurship.
This facility willa provide on hundred million euro Anda could leverage a further five hundred million of microcredit.
But I'm saying to the Commission Anda to the Council, this IS nota nearly enough.
This IS a real opportunity for the EU to be responsive to the real needs of its citizens, buta w need greater investment.
