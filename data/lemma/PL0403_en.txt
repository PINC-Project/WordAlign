Thank you very mucha, +aa+ Chair, Commissioner.
i wanta to congratulate the reporter on +aa+ a great KsiÄ™ga_Joba of work that he Has done on the future of our transport.
i agree that the key for US in Europe would be to boost efficiency in +e+ the transport sector, but to achieve that w shouldn't need a +y+ degree of strategic integration of +a+ our instruments.
The transport polica as a key element of the +y+ twenty twenty strategy should play an important, a key rola for other sectoral policies.
w need to include all member states in our systems, Anda w have to gradually +e+ support +eeeee+ +yyyy+ +yyy+ implementation Anda rollout of intelligent +ee+ technologies.
w need to support trans- +yyy+ border, cross- border projects as well. +e+
for this, w might need a transport funda, but this transport funda should nota cannibalise any money From +aaa+ the cohesion polica.
w have to boost Anda support +ee+ the cohesion polica, nota weaken existing instruments.
