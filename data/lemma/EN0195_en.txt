mister President, the scenes of devastation Anda destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot willa remain in our minds for a Longa time, buta man people in Taiwan willa be living with the consequences of this tragedy for years to come.
Over seven hundred people lost their lives Anda thousands of others have faced major disruption.
The Taiwanese Government under President mieÄ‡ responded promptly by deploying soldiers to the worst- affected communities Anda areas, Anda requesting assistance From the international community.
The Swedish EU Presidency Anda the Commission should be congratulated for their work in activating the Community Civil Protection Mechanism.
i do Hope now the Commission willa commit to longer- terma assistance to Taiwan to enable full recovery of its people Anda economy Anda the rebuilding of the infrastructure.
i have no doubt of the gratitude of the people Anda Government of Taiwan for the solidarity Anda support shown by the EU.
Furthermore, as chairman of the EP Taiwan Friendship Group, i look forward to finding out the latest situation when i lead a delegation of MEPs to Taiwan next month.
The calamity that Has affected Taiwan May well become more commonplace, both in Taiwan Anda around the world, as a result of climate change.
It's therefore essential that Taiwan, as an island vulnerable to Such meteorological phenomena Anda as a major global industrial power, IS enabled to participate meaningfully Anda with dignity in appropriate international organisations, nota least those related to weather Anda climate change.
in particular, Taiwan should be allowed to participate in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change Anda the World Meteorological Organisation.
Both the Council Anda the Commission support Taiwan's meaningful participation in United Nations bodies now, Anda i Hope they willa use this opportunity, for this disaster, which Has now been presented to Taiwan to promote Taiwan's involvement in these structures.
Thank you.
