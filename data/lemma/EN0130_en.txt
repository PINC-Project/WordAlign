+eee+ Thank you, mister Pres~ President, +eeemm+
i support this resolution, e~ even though i think Ita IS nota critical enough of the Sri Lankan Government.
Earlier this year, w witnessed the appalling military assault on the area Held by the Tamil Tigers, without any regard for the lives or well- being of ceti~ citizens WHO were used as pawns indeed, +be+ in my view, by all sides, with the result of ninety thousand dead.
The world stood horrified Anda helpless, yet still today, there are more than a quarter of a million Sri Lankan citizens, +aamm+ +a+ WHO are interned without adequate me~ me~ medical facilities, without clean water, sanitation or living space.
Today's resolution IS a relatively mild call on the Sri Lankan authorities to respect the rights of their citi~ citizens.
Ita IS my own view that Ita IS, IS, that Ita +ddy+ +ddy+ that if there IS no the~ measurable progress soon on the demands in this resolution, Then the european Union must bring economic Anda political pressure to bear on the regime in Sri~ Sri lanka.
Sri lanka depends for its economic recovery on foreign direct investment Anda on EU economic support.
w must use that leverage +yy+ in the interests of the Sri Lankan peoples, including the Tamil people.
Thank you.
