Thank you. President. +yyyyy+
in my holding we've been producing potat~ +yy+ +yyyy+ starch potatoes for a number of years now.
Anda similar to other growers throughout the european Union, i fear that the withdrawal of support to this production, targeting both production Anda +yyyy+ processing industry willa cause very serious problems, Anda i +bb+ +milimetr+ expect that in two thousand +yy+ Anda thirteen they willa see their economic situation deteriorate.
Księga_Sofoniasza i would pronounce myself in favour of maintaining the existing instruments for the potato starch sector.

w need to have minimum prices, Anda w need to have at least a minimum support for a structurni~ restructuring purposes.
+yyy+ When you talk about +y+ the sugar sector reforma, i believe that this IS nota a very fortunate comparison because Ita wy a great failure for the european farmers.
