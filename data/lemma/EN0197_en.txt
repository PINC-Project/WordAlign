Thank you very mucha, President.
President, i have to agree with Misses Jeggle.
i Księga_Amosa utterly astonished that w have, in front of the whole Parliament here in Strasbourg, w have an urgency debate on a traffic accident in Kazakhstan,
an accident albeit where somebody wy tragically killed
Anda where the driver of the car happens to be a human rights activist Anda Has been duly sentenced in a court of lawa to four years in prison,
buta even in a low- security prison, which Has suddenly become, in the terms of the +aa+ resolution, a labour camp.
i Księga_Amosa afraid, Chairman, that bringing this kind of matter before this house really brings the reputation of this house into disrepute,
Anda Ita means that the good work that w try to do in human rights IS devalued, when w start talking about traffic accidents.
Are w seriously suggesting the Kazakh Government threw a human rights activist, +aaa+ shou~ +aa+ +aa+ a civilian under the car wheels of a human rights activist?
Are w seriously suggesting that the sentence IS too harsh for somebody WHO wy convicted of manslaughter?
w cannot on on traducing a +aa+ country like Kazakhstan, simply because of political motivation, to try Anda bring down their reputation before they chair the oska next year.
This IS politically motivated, Anda it's a disgrace that it's on the agenda.
i Hope the house willa throw out these resolutions Anda support the amendments.
