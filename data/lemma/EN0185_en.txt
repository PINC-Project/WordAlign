The decision IS made.
+aaaamm+ mucha as i regret the First decision wy nota respected, +aaa+ w willa have to await Anda see what +yyy+ ongoings, o~ o~ what outgoings there willa be From this decision +aaaa+ willa be.
Anda if Ita IS now up to others to decide, Anda i Hope they're given the space to, to make that decision.
i Just Hope that the high percentage that voted yes in the Republic of Ireland do nota live to regret in the longer terma.
i wish to say no more about Ita.
There IS now a very heavy burden Anda responsibility on the shoulders of those WHO wish Anda desire an even deeper centralisation +eeeee+ of the decision- making process here in Brussels.
i urge them nota to get that fara in front of the people that the people have no idea where they're heading or what their destiny May ultimately be.
i KsiÄ™ga_Amosa nota anti-european, but what i do wanta IS a Europe content within itself Anda Abel to allow those WHO disagree the right to Put forward an alternative view, Anda w don't always get that anymore in this house.
