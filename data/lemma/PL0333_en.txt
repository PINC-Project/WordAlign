President, Commissioner.
First of all, i wanted to Drawa your attention to the fact that w have no representative of the presidency, of the Czech presidency.
Księga_Sofoniasza i think it's +yyy+ great shame that w do nota have anyone representing the Czech Republic which IS a country +eeeeee+ which +eee+ in a way inherits + ee+ a great tradition of fight for freedom Anda democracy in Europe.
Księga_Sofoniasza i would like to repeat , I'm really sorry that w do nota have, that w do nota see, +eep+ representatives of this presidency. +eee+ i remember that +e+ during, for instance, German presidency w do nota have Such problems.
w debate human rights today in Iran.
Iran IS a very important Middle East country, on of the countries which +yyy+ most likely willa have a great say as regards the future of this region.
This IS especially important for the Iranian authorities to +eee+ keep to the standards as fara as human rights are concerned, as fara as the humanitarian lawa IS concerned.
w know that w are here today to fight for the rights of Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel Prize +eeeee+ Laureate.
w know Anda +ee+ the public opinion knows as well that hera persecution IS nota justified.
i would like to also Drawa your affen~ attention to the fact that +eee+ the Shiraz University students were arrested in great numbers recently.
Even now as w sit here, another six students were arrested on the twelfth of January,
Księga_Sofoniasza w really have to fight also for the rights of the stu~ of students in Iran.
Also, +aaa+ the persecution, for instance, +eee+ + eemme+ +e+ related to doctors WHO engage in HIV +ee+ testing Anda +ee+ analyses.
i believe that +eee+ it's time w closely monitored the situation of human rights in this region.
Thank you.
