Ladies Anda gentlemen, President.
i think the EU does need a New strategy which +y+ would allow US to react to the financial crisis.
Anda important element of the strategy should be to enhance the freedom of movement of all kinds of people, students, scientists, pensioners, workers.
Anda this IS clearly mentioned in the resolution.
Ita IS also good that w emphasise the support for small Anda medium enterprises because without them know w cannot get out of this crisis.
Some people think that this strategy doesn't emphasise enough the notion of the cohesion polica.
i would beg to differ because this emphasis IS there. w say that Ita IS important for the future of the Union.
However, if this IS nota implemented, no strategy IS going to help US get on our feet.
