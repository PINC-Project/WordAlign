mister president, ladies Anda gentlemen.
The reporta by mister Janusz Wojciechowski on the council repo~ +eeh+ regulation on the protection of animals at the time of their killing refers to a very important issue of animal welfare.
Indirectly, +eh+ Ita poses a question as to to which extent w are capable of +eh+ breaking with tradition Anda taking into account the feelings Anda anxieties nota only those +ehm+ felt by humans, buta also by animals.
Unfortunately, in spity of the development of our culture Anda civilization, millions of animals Anda birds are being killed year in, year out. Some of them without stunning.
+eh+ hereby w have a question. Why do people WHO are educated Anda civilised treat animals as barbarians would?
What can w do in order to change this situation?
The reporta addresses some of these questions, buta Ita fails to solve some Basic issues related to the legislation concerning ritual slaughtering Anda the consciousness, the approach of the citizens.
w need to solve these problems in the New terma of office of the parliament Anda the +eh+ commission.
i Hope that further work willa be underscored by the feeling that an animal his a feeling~ IS a feeling being Anda w need to respect Ita Anda protect Ita.
Thank you.
