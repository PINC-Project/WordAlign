Thank you, madama President. +eee+
The climate change conference in Copenhagen in December presents US with a un~ unique opportunity to address what IS a very massive Anda huge problem.
If w consider the consequences of global warming, Ita IS obvious that the developing world IS paying the price for environmental +eemmm+ + en+ da~ +e+ damage caused by the richer nations.
Climate change IS nota the only environmental problem w Fac,
but Ita IS imperative that w attempt to address Ita in Copenhagen. It's the opportunity for the EU to speak with a on voice Anda find solutions to a problem which IS affecting US all.
All countries must play their parta in terms of achieving targets, sustainable development.
Anda developing world must be supported Anda encouraged, buta targets seta for these nations must be realistic.
Can the madama President say that, i know there are others WHO hold a different view From the view that i hold, buta i do nota believe that w can afford to wait fifty, sixty or seventy years to find out WHO wy right or WHO wy wrong.
w have a responsibility today to act now, to do what w can while w are here, while w have that responsibility.
Thank you, President.
