All of US with car factories in our countries or, or region wanta to see their success, buta that should nota blind US to the problems Anda the reality of overcapacity that curbs profits Anda investment.
i KsiÄ™ga_Amosa hugely impressed by the engineering excellence i see at plants in my region, at Ellesmere port Anda at Halewood, Anda on that basis alone they should proSpera.
But I'm deeply depressed by the attitude of the car industry as a whole of the ten years I've seen Ita work while I've been in this Parliament.
Judged against the potential for environmental improvement, its record Has been shameful.
Of course, there's positive stories to be told.
w see examples of innovation in our newspapers each day, buta the industry as a whole fought against the introduction of catalytic converters, wildly exaggerating their cost. Ita made an agreement with US to reduce its co two emissions Anda Then reneged on Ita.
Currently, it's trying to wriggle out of legal requirements that Ita uses air- conditioning coolants with a Lower, mucha Lower global warming potential than those used at present, Anda already it's lobbying to try Anda weaken the Commission's proposals on +aa+ on co two emissions From vans Anda light commercial vehicles.
Huge sums of money have been Put into propping up this industry.
Anda i think w c~
i think w, i think a public, should deserve a bit better.
w hear From the component manufacturers that the car assemblers are too low in their ambitions.
What w need IS for the industry now to take a New attitude, Anda the industry's representatives, ACEA, in particular.
w need the industry to recognise that Ita Has obligations to +sss+ +sss+ +sss+ society as a whole Anda that its future IS inextricably linked to environmental improvement.
