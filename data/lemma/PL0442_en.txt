Thank you.
Thank you very mucha, +eee+ madama Chair.
I'd like to thank the reporter WHO Has leda to compromise which IS extremely difficult in energy matters.
I'd like to thank +yy+ the Commissioner for getting involved i~ in the +yy+ Gas contract between Poland Anda Russia.
w +yy+ really appreciate the rola of the european Commission.
The issue of energy in contemporary Europe IS the fact +e+ that determines +ee+ the independence of man states.
That IS why I'm amazed to hear some of the voices in this room WHO are stating that Ita IS Just an energy issue, +ee+ Just an economic issue, that that IS the only dimension of our discussion.
no!
man countries in Europe treat energy as +e+ the w~ factor that determines their independence.
If anybody read a~ any Russian document on that,
you willa see that Russians play two piać in terms of energy.
The First on IS the economic piać Anda the second on IS political Anda security, related to security.
Księga_Sofoniasza, if w miss anything today, w miss a greater involvement, also by the agendas of the european Commission that are responsible for the external matters Księga_Sofoniasza that w can play on two pianos as well.
