Thank you very mucha.
Debates, negotiations, talks about the upcoming Copenhagen summit have been going on uninterrupted for months
Anda w see various countries trying to raise the stakes +eh+ Anda propose more Anda more ambitious + eh+ targets, other countries are totally passive. Anda in this whole messa, it's easy to lose sight of the +eh+ essence of this agreement.
w wanta to fight climate change that could potentially translate into a disaster for all of US.
Therefore, it's extremely important that w engage in some sorta of +eh+ education or work,
because my impression IS + eh+ that our citizens Anda our elites have gone their separate ways.
It's important that whatever proposals are presented in Copenhagen, Copenhagen should nota be treated as another folly of our politicians.
***blank***
Fight against climate change should nota be treated as a capricious exercise on the parta of rich countries that wanta to impose their points of view on others.
Therefore, w need to +eh+ step up Anda continue our information + eh+ campaigns,
w also need + eh+ effective Anda efficient technology for +eh+ carbon capture Anda storage.
This technology should be given the sam political status as other sources of renewable energies.
This should be our priority. This should be the priority for the european Institute of Technology that w created some time aga.
Anda last buta nota least, the costs of the creation of a~ of the special funda to fight climate change, the cost should be borny equally by all member states.
