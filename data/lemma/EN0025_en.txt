Anda that IS to harness the huge potential of public procurement throughout the european Unio~ Union, to stimulate innovative product Anda services.
Anda i wanta to ask him today if he would take up the recommendations endorsed almost unanimously by this Parliament in my reporta last November, which showed how this could be done.
Anda Just to give him an idea Anda to share Ita with colleagues, if on per cent of european public procurement wy secured for innovative products Anda services, Ita would raise the investment in innovation across the european Union by no less than fifteen billion euros.
