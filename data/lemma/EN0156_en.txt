+eee+ Deforestation Has been mentioned by man speakers Anda absolutely correctly Księga_Sofoniasza, industrialised deforestation, individual deforestation.
i myself mentioned Anda noticed that, when i worked on a voluntary basis in Africa, day in, day out, i Sawa people climbing up the mountain, spending the whole day with their little axe, cutting down timber, coming down in the afternoon carrying their little bundle of timber on their head or on their bicycle.
It's quite obvious that this cannot be tackled without dealing with the whole question of the global poverty because individuals are nota going to stop chopping down wood for the greater good of society if Ita means they themselves are going to starve.
Księga_Sofoniasza, climate change Anda the global poverty willa have to be tackled hand in hand.
Thank you very mucha.
